                <p>
                    The Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and CryptoGifting Pty. Ltd., which is a
                    company incorporated under the laws of South Africa. For further information on CryptoGifting Pty.

                    of
                    these Terms, any reference to “we” “us” “our” “CryptoGifting” and/or any similar term shall be

                <p>
                    By registering for and opening a CryptoGifting Account, you unconditionally accept these Terms and
                    agree
                    to be bound by and act in accordance with them. You also accept and agree that you are solely

                    jurisdiction in which you live that may be applicable to your use of the CryptoGifting Site and/or
                    your
                    CryptoGifting Account, including but not limited to, those related to export or import activity,
                    taxes
                    or foreign currency transactions. Depending on your country of residence, you may not be able to use
                    all
                    the functions of the CryptoGifting Site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please read these Terms carefully before using the CryptoGifting Site because they affect your legal
                    rights and obligations.
                </p>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">2. Amendment of terms</h4>

                <p>
                    CryptoGifting may amend the Terms from time to time. You should visit the CryptoGifting website
                    regularly to check when the Terms were last updated (as displayed at the top of this document) and
                    to
                    review the current Terms. We will do our best to notify you of any amendments to the Terms that we
                    consider likely to materially affect your rights and obligations. Any such notice will be posted on
                    the
                    CryptoGifting Site, or sent by email to the address associated with your CryptoGifting Account
                    (see <a href="#Electronic-Communications">Electronic Communications</a> in Clause 5 below).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The continued use of your CryptoGifting Account, after any amendment to these Terms, constitutes
                    your
                    acceptance of the Terms, as modified by such amendment. If you do not accept the Terms, or any
                    amendment
                    to them, you must immediately stop using the CryptoGifting Site and your CryptoGifting Account
                </p>

                    </li>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You will provide security for transactions carried out through your CryptoGifting Account by
                        ensuring
                        there is sufficient Local Currency or cryptocurrency (as the case may be) in your CryptoGifting
                        Account

                        unless

                        in Clause 8

                    <li>
                        You will not allow or facilitate the withdrawal of Local Currency from your CryptoGifting Wallet
                        to a
                        bank account held in the name of a third party (see <a href="#Withdrawals">Withdrawals</a> in
                        Clause 9
                        below);

                    <li>
                        You will not use your CryptoGifting Account for or in relation to any illegal activity,

                    <li>You are not a national or resident of the United States of America.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Any capitalised terms used in this Eligibility section shall have the meaning given to them in these
                    Terms. Reference in these Terms to “Local Currency” means fiat or government issued currency (e.g.
                    GBP, EUR, ZAR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    By opening a CryptoGifting Account you accept and agree that CryptoGifting may, without further
                    notice and in its sole discretion, terminate, suspend or restrict the account of any customer who
                    uses, or who we reasonably suspect may be using, the CryptoGifting Site or any CryptoGifting Account
                    in a manner that is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of these Terms.
                </p>


                <h4 class="sub-heading">4. Risks</h4>
                <p>
                    Before using the CryptoGifting Site, you should ensure that you understand the risks involved in
                    buying, selling or trading cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency markets can be volatile and prices can
                    fluctuate significantly, which could result in sudden and significant increases or decreases in the
                    value of your assets. This market volatility and other risks involved in buying, selling or trading
                    cryptocurrencies are explained on the <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">risk warning</a> page of the CryptoGifting
                    website. There may be additional risks not identified in these Terms or in the <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">risk
                        warning</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and risk tolerance is suitable for
                    buying, selling or trading cryptocurrency. You accept and agree that you are solely responsible for
                    any decision to buy, sell, trade or otherwise hold or deal with cryptocurrency.
                </p>

                <h4 class="sub-heading" id="Electronic-Communications">5. Electronic communications</h4>
                <p>You accept and agree that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>any communications, agreements, notices and/or any other documents (together “Communications”)
                        relating to your CryptoGifting Account or your use of CryptoGifting’s services will be provided
                        to you electronically by posting them on the CryptoGifting Site, emailing them to the email
                        address you have provided to us, or through any other form of electronic communication. You
                        consent to receiving all Communications electronically;</li>
                    <li>you will at all times have available to you the necessary hardware and software to receive,
                        access and retain Communications sent to you electronically, including a device with an internet
                        connection and a valid and accessible email address;</li>
                    <li>you assume full responsibility for providing CryptoGifting with a valid and accessible email
                        address to which any Communications may be sent, and for ensuring that email address and any
                        other contact information is kept up to date. Any Communication sent to the email address you
                        have provided to us will be deemed to have been received by you. You can amend your contact
                        information by signing-in to your CryptoGifting Account and accessing the Settings page.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You may at any time withdraw your consent to receiving Communications electronically by
                    contacting <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">support@CryptoGifting.com</a>. You acknowledge that failure to give, or
                    withdrawing, consent to receiving Communications electronically puts the security of your
                    CryptoGifting Account at risk (see <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">Account Security</a> in Clause 13 below) and that
                    CryptoGifting reserves the right to close your CryptoGifting Account in the event you fail to give,
                    or withdraw, your consent to the receipt of Communications electronically.
                </p>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">6. Identity verification</h4>

                <p>CryptoGifting implements and maintains the highest standards of Know Your Customer (“KYC”) processes
                    and controls as part of our commitment to combating fraud and assisting in the prevention of money
                    laundering and terrorist financing. While our industry is largely unregulated, CryptoGifting
                    voluntarily adheres to local and international compliance standards in relation to customer due
                    diligence, as explained on the Compliance page of the CryptoGifting website.</p>
                <p>To ensure we meet these standards, our customers are required to provide certain personal details and
                    documents when opening a CryptoGifting Account (“Identity Verification”). The nature and extent of
                    the Identity Verification required will depend upon which of our supported countries you are
                    resident in, and the deposit and withdrawal limits that you wish to apply to your CryptoGifting
                    Account. In certain circumstances, CryptoGifting may also perform enhanced due diligence (“EDD”)
                    procedures in relation to your CryptoGifting Account. You accept and agree that you will remain
                    subject to such procedures at all times.</p>
                <p>CryptoGifting reserves the right to, at any time:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>restrict or suspend your CryptoGifting Account when we, in our sole discretion, consider it
                        necessary to carry out further Identity Verification and/or EDD; or</li>
                    <li>terminate your CryptoGifting Account if you provide, or we suspect you have provided, false
                        information or refuse to provide information we require for Identity Verification and/or EDD.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>You accept and agree that there may be delays in accessing your CryptoGifting Account, or in carrying
                    out transactions through your CryptoGifting Account, while we undertake any Identity Verification
                    and/or EDD procedures.</p>
                <p><b class="text-bold">Retention of information.</b> CryptoGifting is required to retain certain
                    information and
                    documentation
                    obtained as part of the Identity Verification and EDD procedures. These requirements apply even when
                    you have terminated your relationship with CryptoGifting. We reserve the right to keep such
                    information and documentation for the required period and you accept and agree that information and
                    documentation you provide to CryptoGifting may be retained by us, including following the closure of
                    your CryptoGifting Account.</p>


                <h4 class="sub-heading">7. The CryptoGifting wallet</h4>
                <p>The CryptoGifting Wallet allows you to send, receive and store cryptocurrency (together,
                    “CryptoGifting Wallet Transactions”).</p>
                <p><b class="text-bold">Supported Cryptocurrencies</b>. The CryptoGifting Wallet is only available in
                    relation to the
                    cryptocurrencies that CryptoGifting, in its sole discretion, decides to support (“Supported
                    Cryptocurrency” or “Supported Cryptocurrencies”). Information about the Supported Cryptocurrencies
                    can be found on the Supported Cryptocurrency page on the CryptoGifting website. The Supported
                    Cryptocurrencies may change from time to time. Under no circumstances should you attempt to carry
                    out a CryptoGifting Wallet Transaction in relation to a cryptocurrency other than a Supported
                    Cryptocurrency. In particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you accept and
                    agree that you will have no access, entitlement or claim:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>to any cryptocurrency sent to a receive address associated with your CryptoGifting Wallet where
                        that cryptocurrency is not a Supported Cryptocurrency; or</li>
                    <li>to any cryptocurrency sent to a receive address associated with your CryptoGifting Wallet, where
                        that receive address is associated with another cryptocurrency. For example, you will have no
                        access, entitlement or claim to any Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sent to a Bitcoin (BTC) receive address.
                    </li>

                    specific goods and/or services from selected third parties using your Local Currency balance. You
                    accept and agree that any such purchase will be subject to these Terms.</p>

                        Verification</a> requirements),
                    you may deposit Local Currency into your CryptoGifting Wallet by depositing funds into a
                    CryptoGifting bank account (a “Deposit”). The CryptoGifting bank account into which you make a
                    Deposit will be a segregated account used exclusively for the purpose of holding and processing
                    customer funds. Subject to these Terms, you retain a right to any funds you deposit into the
                    CryptoGifting bank account until such time as your funds are used or withdrawn.</p>
                <p>Details of the CryptoGifting bank account into which you must make the Deposit will be provided to
                    you by CryptoGifting, and any such bank account will be held and operated by a CryptoGifting
                    operating entity in your country or region (for more information on these entities, see the Company
                    Information page on the CryptoGifting website). You accept and agree that any information you
                    provide to CryptoGifting may be shared with such local entity, which will process Local Currency
                    transactions in accordance with CryptoGifting’s instructions.</p>
                <p>The payment methods by which you may Deposit Local Currency will depend upon the country you are in,
                    and are set out on the <a href="{{route('OurFees')}}">Fees and Features</a> page of the CryptoGifting
                    website (for the
                    purposes of
                    these Terms, the “Supported Deposit Methods”). Where you have made a Deposit using a Supported
                    Deposit Method, and have adhered to the Deposit Requirements (explained below), your Deposit will be
                    allocated to your CryptoGifting Wallet.</p>
                <p>Due to legal and operational constraints, you must strictly adhere to the following Deposit
                    requirements (the “Deposit Requirements”):</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>you may only make a Deposit from a Supported Deposit Method held in your own name. You must not
                        allow any third party to make a Deposit into your CryptoGifting Wallet;</li>
                    <li>you may only Deposit Local Currency using a Supported Deposit Method compatible with the deposit
                        methods available in your country or region;</li>
                    <li>except in the case of a SEPA transfer, you may only make Deposits denominated in the Local
                        Currency associated with your CryptoGifting Wallet. For example, if you have a ZAR wallet, you
                        must only make Deposits in South African Rand;</li>
                    <li>where you make a Deposit using a credit or debit card, you authorise CryptoGifting to facilitate
                        the debiting of the funds from your bank account in order to complete the Deposit;</li>
                    <li>you must not use cash or cheques to make a Deposit. CryptoGifting reserves the right to refuse
                        any Deposit made by cash or cheque. Should CryptoGifting decide, in its sole discretion, to
                        allow a Deposit by cash or cheque on an exceptional basis, the allocation of such Deposit will
                        be delayed to allow fraud and compliance checks to take place, and a Cash Deposit Penalty (see
                        the <a href="{{route('OurFees')}}">Fees and Features</a> page of the CryptoGifting website) may be
                        deducted from
                        it. Any
                        CryptoGifting Account that receives more than one cash or cheque deposit may, at CryptoGifting’s
                        sole discretion, be suspended indefinitely.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>You agree to abide by the Deposit Requirements and agree and accept that failure to do so may cause
                    delay in or failure of any Deposit reflecting in your CryptoGifting Wallet, and/or restriction,
                    suspension or termination of your CryptoGifting Account.</p>

                    you
                    will be provided with a Reference Number or Unique Deposit Amount. To permit timely and successful
                    allocation of a Deposit to your CryptoGifting Wallet, you must use the Reference Number or Unique
                    Deposit Amount when you make a deposit using a Supported Deposit Method. CryptoGifting will not be
                    responsible for any delay in or non-allocation of Deposits to your CryptoGifting Wallet where you
                    fail to specify the required Reference Number or Unique Deposit Amount.</p>
                <p>Deposits may take time to reflect in your CryptoGifting Wallet due to bank processing times,
                    operational processes, and/or failure by you to adhere to the Deposit Requirements. Under no
                    circumstances will CryptoGifting have any liability to you in relation to any delay in or failure of
                    a Deposit reflecting in your CryptoGifting Wallet.</p>
                <p>CryptoGifting will make all reasonable efforts to allocate Deposits that do not meet the Deposit
                    Requirements. However, any Deposits less than the Minimum Unallocated Deposit Amount that cannot be
                    allocated within a one month period will be retained by CryptoGifting and you accept and agree that
                    you shall have no further claim or entitlement to such funds. The Minimum Unallocated Deposit Amount
                    shall until otherwise determined by CryptoGifting be USD10.00 or the equivalent in your Local

                <h4 class="sub-heading">15. Transactions on cryptocurrency networks</h4>
                <p>When you use your CryptoGifting Account to send or receive cryptocurrency, the transaction must be
                    confirmed and recorded in the public ledger associated with the relevant cryptocurrency network
                    (e.g. the Bitcoin network). That cryptocurrency network is solely
                    responsible for verifying and confirming any such transactions. CryptoGifting cannot confirm, cancel
                    or reverse transactions on a cryptocurrency network, other than confirming to you that the network
                    has completed the transaction. You accept and agree that:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Once submitted to a cryptocurrency network, a transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of
                        time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the network. A transaction is not
                        complete while it is in a pending state. Funds associated with transactions that are in a
                        pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your CryptoGifting
                        Wallet balance or be available to you to conduct transactions;</li>
                    <li>When you send cryptocurrency from your CryptoGifting Account, you are authorising us to submit
                        your transaction request to the relevant cryptocurrency network. Once a transaction request has
                        been submitted to the relevant cryptocurrency network, the network will automatically complete
                        or reject the request and neither you or CryptoGifting will be able to cancel or otherwise
                        modify your transaction.</li>
                    <li>Cryptocurrency networks are operated by decentralised networks of independent third parties.
                        They are not owned, controlled or operated by CryptoGifting so we cannot ensure that any
                        transaction details you submit will be confirmed by the relevant cryptocurrency network. You
                        agree that any transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially
                        delayed, by the cryptocurrency network used to process the transaction.</li>

                    operation of the Supported Cryptocurrencies are open source. Accordingly, anyone can use, copy,
                    modify, and distribute them and CryptoGifting has no ownership of or control over these
                    protocols. By using the CryptoGifting Site, you accept and agree that:</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>the underlying software protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as
                        “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or name of any
                        cryptocurrency you store in your CryptoGifting Account. Should a fork occur, CryptoGifting may,
                        with or without notice to you, temporarily suspend our operations and, in our sole discretion,
                        decide whether or not to support either branch of the forked protocol entirely; and</li>
                    <li>in the event CryptoGifting decides not to support a branch of a forked protocol, you will not be
                        given access to the assets on that fork. Those assets will be securely held by CryptoGifting and
                        we will not buy or sell them.</li>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">16. Account inactivity</h4>


                <p>Local Currency deposited into your CryptoGifting Wallet may only be used for the purchase of

                    equivalent in your Local Currency), which shall be collected from the Local Currency held in your
                    CryptoGifting Wallet. Should we have reasonable grounds on which to suspect you are using your
                    CryptoGifting Wallet primarily for the purpose of storing Local Currency, CryptoGifting reserves the
                    right to restrict, suspend or terminate your CryptoGifting Account.</p>
                <p><b class="text-bold">Unclaimed property</b>. In the event any funds are held in your CryptoGifting

                    CryptoGifting
                    has no record of any use of your CryptoGifting Account for several years, and we are unable to
                    contact you, the law in your jurisdiction may require us to report and deliver such funds to the
                    relevant authorities as unclaimed property. To the extent permitted by applicable law, CryptoGifting
                    reserves the right to deduct a dormancy fee or other administrative charges from such unclaimed

                <h4 class="sub-heading">17. Closure of your account</h4>

                <p>You may close your CryptoGifting Account by submitting a <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">closure request</a> via the Help
                    Centre.
                    CryptoGifting will action such requests once (i) the sum of all Local Currency and cryptocurrency
                    balances in your CryptoGifting Wallet(s) is below the Minimum Closure Amount; and (ii) no
                    transactions have taken place in your CryptoGifting Account for a period of at least 30 days. Such
                    requirements are designed to protect you from loss and CryptoGifting will not action a closure
                    request until they are satisfied.</p>
                <p>You accept and acknowledge that, once your CryptoGifting Account is closed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you will have no further access to it;</li>
                    <li>CryptoGifting will be under no obligation to notify you of, or provide to you, any

                    <li>CryptoGifting reserves the right (but has no obligation) to delete all of your information and

                        is required for legal or operational reasons.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>If at the date of closure of your account any Local Currency or cryptocurrency remains in your

                    and agree that CryptoGifting shall retain such funds and that you shall have no further claim to
                    them. The Minimum Closure Amount shall be USD10.00 or the equivalent in your Local Currency.</p>
                <p>You accept and agree that CryptoGifting shall not be liable to you or any third party in relation to
                    the closure of your CryptoGifting Account, the termination of access to your CryptoGifting Account,

                    of the disclaimers in this section may not apply to you.</p>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">25. Limitation of liability</h4>
                <p>In no event shall CryptoGifting, its operating entities or any other affiliates (including their
                    respective directors, members, employees or agents) be liable to you for any direct, indirect,
                    special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages or any other damages of any kind, including
                    but not limited to loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of opportunity, loss of
                    data, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or in any way connected with your use
                    of, inability to use, or unavailability of the CryptoGifting Site and/or your CryptoGifting Account,
                    including without limitation any damages caused by or resulting from any reliance upon any
                    information received from CryptoGifting, or that result from mistakes, omissions, interruptions,
                    deletion of files or email, errors, defects, viruses, delays in operation or transmission or any
                    failure of performance, whether or not resulting from a force majeure event, communications failure,
                    theft, destruction or unauthorised access to CryptoGifting’s records, programmes or services.</p>
                <p>In no event will any liability of CryptoGifting, its operating entities or any other affiliates
                    (including their respective directors, members, employees or agents) arising in relation to your use
                    of the CryptoGifting Site or your CryptoGifting Account, exceed (in aggregate) the fees earned by
                    CryptoGifting in connection with your use of your CryptoGifting Account in the six month period
                    immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim for liability.</p>
                <p>The above limitations of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the
                    applicable jurisdiction. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties
                    or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, some of the
                    limitations in this section may not apply to you.</p>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">26. Indemnity</h4>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify CryptoGifting, its operating entities
                    or any other affiliates (including their respective directors, members, employees and/or agents)
                    against any action, liability, cost, claim, loss, damage, proceeding or expense suffered or incurred
                    directly or indirectly arising from your use of or conduct in relation to the CryptoGifting Site
                    and/or your CryptoGifting Account, or from your violation of these Terms. </p>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">27. USDC</h4>
                <p>You may elect to purchase or sell USD Coin ("USDC") through CryptoGifting. USDC is governed by
                    Centre, a membership-based consortium founded by Circle Internet Financial Limited (“Circle”) that
                    sets technical, policy and financial standards for USDC (“Centre”). By acquiring USDC, you
                    acknowledge that you will become the owner of the balance held in your USDC wallet and that,
                    accordingly, you agree to abide by any rules or technical standards set by Centre and/or the
                    applicable USDC issuer, including (without limitation) the Circle USDC Agreement (located
                    at <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">support.usdc.circle.com</a> ). For the avoidance of doubt, CryptoGifting is not the
                    issuer of USDC,
                    does not hold US Dollars on reserve for USDC holders, and has no obligation to repurchase or redeem
                    your USDC for any fiat currency. Any redemption of USDC should be done against the issuer directly.
                    CryptoGifting reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any service in relation to USDC
                    at any time, without notice and without attracting any liability therefor.</p>

                <p>You may initiate recurring transactions to or from your CryptoGifting Wallet(s) (“Repeat-Buy”). If
                    you initiate a Repeat-Buy, you acknowledge and undertake that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>despite any quoted price, your Repeat-Buy transaction will be executed at the prevailing market
                        price offered on the CryptoGifting Platform at the time that we execute the relevant Repeat-Buy
                        order;</li>
                    <li>you authorize us to initiate recurring electronic payments to and from your CryptoGifting Wallet
                        in accordance with your selected Supported Cryptocurrency and any corresponding Supported
                        Deposit Method, such as debiting of the funds from your bank account or other payment account.
                        your Repeat-Buy transaction will occur in identical, periodic installments, based on your
                        selection (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or CryptoGifting cancels the Repeat
                        Buy;</li>
                    <li>where you have set up Repeat-Buy to execute against your CryptoGifting Wallet, the Repeat-Buy
                        transaction will be executed against the positive balance of available funds held in your
                        applicable CryptoGifting Wallet (i.e. this does not include funds which are related to any open
                        orders on the CryptoGifting Platform) (“Available Funds”) . You must ensure that you have
                        sufficient Available Funds in your CryptoGifting Wallet to pay for your Repeat-Buy on the
                        scheduled payment date;</li>
                    <li>if any Repeat-Buy fails 3 (three) consecutive times, then we shall have the right to cancel or
                        pause your Repeat-Buy; and</li>
                    <li>we may charge you a Repeat-Buy fee which will be charged in addition to any other fees and costs
                        listed on our fees and features page</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">29. Disputes</h4>
                <p>You and we agree to notify the other party in writing of any claim or dispute that arises in relation
                    to the CryptoGifting Site, your CryptoGifting Account or these Terms, within 30 days of such claim
                    or dispute arising. You and we further agree to attempt informal resolution of any Dispute prior to
                    bringing a claim in any court or other body.</p>
                <p><b class="text-bold">Governing law and jurisdiction</b>. This agreement shall be governed by and
                    construed in
                    accordance with
                    Singapore law, subject to any local mandatory rights you may have. You and we agree to submit all
                    disputes, claims or controversies (including non-contractual Disputes, claims or controversies)
                    arising out of or in connection with these Terms, or the breach, termination, enforcement or
                    interpretation thereof (together, Disputes), to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
                    Singapore.</p>
                <p><b class="text-bold">Class or representative action waiver</b>. To the maximum extent permissible by
                    law, you and
                    CryptoGifting each agree that each may bring any Dispute against the other only in your or its
                    individual capacity, and you and it waive any right to commence or participate in any class action
                    or other representative action or proceeding against the other. Further, where permissible by law,
                    unless both you and CryptoGifting agree otherwise, no court may consolidate any other person’s
                    claim(s) with your Dispute, and may not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class
                    proceeding.</p>
                <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if this Class or representative action waiver is found by any court of
                    competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Disputes clause
                    shall remain valid and enforceable.</p>

                <h4 class="sub-heading">30. Miscellaneous</h4>
                <p><b class="text-bold">Entire agreement</b>. These Terms constitute the entire agreement and

                    effect as the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, given the content and purpose of these
