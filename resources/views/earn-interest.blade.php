                        Presenting the new CryptoGifting Savings Wallet. Simply move your BTC and ETH in and you'll earn a
                        targeted rate of <span>2 to 4%* interest per annum.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's that easy. Your earnings are then paid in the same cryptocurrency directly into your Savings
                        Wallet
                        on the first day of each month. You can either choose to withdraw them straight away, or leave your
                        earnings in your Savings Wallet to compound and grow exponentially. So, say you move 1 BTC into your
                        Savings Wallet and choose to leave your earnings to grow, two years later you'll have 1.08314 BTC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are no fixed terms, no admin fees, and your funds can be moved into your normal wallet
                        whenever you need.

                    <p>
                        The need for a savings account has been brought into sharp focus over the past year, in large part
                        due to the economic uncertainty created by COVID-19. Countries across the world have slashed
                        interest rates, with some even introducing negative rates. This means savers are currently facing a
                        dearth of options.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a survey carried out by CryptoGifting earlier this year, more than a third of respondents (35%)
                        said they're not currently earning any interest on their cash savings at all. More than half of
                        respondents (54%) further added that they're not earning interest through their current or savings
                        bank account.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a time of economic uncertainty, a Savings Wallet is a safe alternative for anyone looking to make
                        meaningful savings on their money. Almost 95% of our customers have said they want to earn interest
                        on their cryptocurrencies, and because of the nature of Bitcoin, we're able to offer a
                        much higher interest rate than traditional savings accounts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Savings Wallet arrives at a time when traditional investments have shown vulnerability at a time
                        of crisis. There has never been a better time to utilise a currency that doesn't rely on a healthy
                        economy to determine its value.

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">FAQS</h4>

                    <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">Why is the interest only targeted at 4% for Bitcoin?</a>

                    <p class="mt-4">
                        The interest you'll earn on the funds in your BTC Savings Wallet is targeted at 4%, but this number
                        will vary according to market conditions. This means it could be less than 4% or it could be more
                        than 4%. What do we mean by market conditions? Good question! The funds transferred into your
                        Savings Wallet are lent to our chosen lending partner to generate a return. Market conditions
                        (supply vs. demand) influence the percentage return that they generate.

                        CryptoGifting has partnered with Valr to bring you this savings wallet who are partners with
                        Genesis. Genesis are another company operating under the Digital Currency Group umbrella. Genesis
                        are the world's largest lender of digital assets and helps clients increase capital efficiency and
                        access alternative liquidity for hedging, speculation, institutional market-making and working
                        capital needs. They've been in operation since 2013 and are one of the most respected names in the
                        industry.

                    <p>
                        While we've taken every precaution to choose the right lending partner, there are some risks
                        involved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should be aware that any funds transferred into your Savings Wallet will be lent to our chosen
                        lending partner. This is in order for them to generate a return, which is how interest is earned.
                        Your savings wallet is not a traditional fiat currency bank account, and cryptocurrency accounts are
                        not covered by deposit protection insurance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Our lending partner collateralises their loans (ie. they take security), and we're confident in the
                        robustness of their lending platform. CryptoGifting doesn't, however, guarantee the funds held in
                        your CryptoGifting Savings Wallet, and you accordingly agree to take on the risk of counterparty
                        default by utilising the Savings Wallet. Please carefully read the <a href="{{route('ContactUs')}}">Savings Wallet
                            terms</a> so that you're fully informed of any risks involved in using the Savings Wallet
