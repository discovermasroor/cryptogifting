                                The interest rate offered on the Savings Wallet is variable, and accordingly may
                                fluctuate
                                from time to time. The applicable interest rate will be communicated to you via the
                                CryptoGifting Site, but will vary depending on prevailing market conditions, and the
                                interest rates offered by our Lending Partner(s). We will determine the applicable
                                interest
                                rates, in our sole discretion, and you acknowledge that such rates may not be equivalent

                                Interest will be payable in arrears and will be capitalised (i.e. credited) to the
                                principal
                                amount held in your Savings Wallet on the first day of each calendar month. Interest
                                will be
                                calculated by applying a daily effective rate to the principal amount in your Savings
                                Wallet
                                on each day, which is calculated by dividing the applicable effective interest rate by

                                (subject to section <span>[16]</span> below). Once interest has been credited to your

                                it
                                will be compounded to the capital amount, whereafter you will earn interest on such
